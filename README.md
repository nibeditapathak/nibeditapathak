# Hi, I'm Nibedita Pathak 👋🏾 👩🏾‍💻

I have completed my graduation in Law. Also I do  freelancing services to help organizations and individuals to imply best practices for data privacy and security (including computer networks and information services), maintain compliance with privacy laws and regulations, and conduct risk assessments to identify potential privacy threats. I also advise on privacy-related issues, develop privacy policies and procedures, and manage data breaches.
